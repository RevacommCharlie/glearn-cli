# Do not edit this file; it will be replaced the next time you run the preview command.

# To manually order the contents of this curriculum rather than using the auto-generated file,
# include a config.yaml in your repo following the same conventions as this auto-generated file.
# A user-created config.yaml will have priority over the auto-generated one.
